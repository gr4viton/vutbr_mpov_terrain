Implementation of Semi-Supervised Kernel Mean Shift Clustering (SKMS) algorithm presented in:
[1] S. Anand, S. Mittal, O. Tuzel and P. Meer "Semi-supervised Kernel Mean Shift Clustering",
IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Machine Intell. (to appear) 

We propose a semi-supervised framework for kernel mean shift clustering (SKMS) that uses only pairwise constraints to guide the clustering procedure. The data points are first mapped to a high-dimensional kernel space where the constraints are imposed by a linear transformation of the mapped points. This is achieved by modifying the initial kernel matrix by minimizing a log det divergence-based objective function.

Examples for the following applications are provided:
1. Ten concentric circles
2. Five olympic circles 

In the paper [1], we tested SKMS on four real examples. 

The mex functions (64 bit Windows) for the core functions are provided. To compile the core C/C++ files and generate the platform-specific dlls, use the following command on the Matlab command prompt: 

>> mex logdet_learn_LRK_mex.cpp


To develop the code for a new application, the script 'run_SKMS.m' can be followed as an example. Some of the key steps are described below. Most of the variable names are consistent with the ones used in [1] above.

Key Variables:
-----------------------------------------
Name							Purpose
-----------------------------------------
Input variables:
X								Data matrix (n x d)
C								Pairwise constraint matrix (n_c x 2)

Variables computed:
K0								Initial kernel matrix (n x n)
K_skms							Learned kernel matrix (n x n)
k 								Bandwidth parameter for kernel mean shift clustering
